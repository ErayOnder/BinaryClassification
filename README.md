Two different binary classification tasks that I've done at my internship.
One of them was designed for a balanced dataset and one was for an imbalanced dataset.
Obviously I had to delete any private information related to datasets due to it's being company's private data.
However, the methodologies and techniques I used are generic, meaning that they can be used for any binary classification tasks with slight modifications depending on the dataset that is being dealt with of course :)
